# Measure-Distance-Using-Ultrasonic-And-AVR
	ATmega16 Microcontroller with frequency 8Mhz.
	Measure the distance using the Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04.
	The ultrasonic sensor works on the principle of SONAR and RADAR system which is used to determine the distance to an object.
	The LCD should display the distance value.
	Code implemented in form of drivers.
	Project is based on Concept of software layers.
